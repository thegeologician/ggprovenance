Description: Plotting functions wrapping extended and user friendly graphical
    output around the calculations provided by package provenance. Plots are
    returned as ggplot objects, and can be further modified/combined with ggplot2's
    functions, which also provide export to many file formats. Helper functions to
    easily read common formats of input data are provided (requires ggdat).
