# ggprovenance

**AS OF YET IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT PHASE, COMPLETE CODE REWRITE! MANY THINKS ARE MISSING / WILL NOT WORK...**

A package using H. Wickham's `ggplot2` to produce data plots commonly used in sediment provenance analysis. This package uses P. Vermeesch's `provenance` package for calculations, but adds 'aesthetics' (cf. `ggplot2`), like colour, symbols, linetypes. Output can easily be exported into a range of file formats thanks to `ggsave()` or further edited with e.g. `theme()`. Several helper functions of general use are provided.

To install, if you do not have `devtools` installed, run:
```
install.packages("devtools")
```
Then pull the latest version from GitHub:
```
devtools::install_github("thegeologician/ggprovenance")
```

The main workhorse functions are:  

* `plotKDE()`  
* `plotMDS()`  
* `plotTernary()`  

Besides, functions to easily import data from common file formats like csv and xls (thanks to the `gdata` package), and to convert these to/from data objects used by `provenance`, are provided, as well as 'lesser' plotting functions like `plotDendrogram()` and `plotShepard()`. See helpfiles and vignette.
